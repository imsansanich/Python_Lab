# Python Data Analysis Projects

This repository showcases my Python skills for data analysis, acquired during an **IBM course**.

Throughout the coursework, I gained extensive hands-on experience working with Python for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. **I completed numerous assignments and actively participated in a vast number of lab exercises.** This continuous learning process, involving various datasets and analytical challenges, is something I genuinely enjoy and find very engaging.

## Python Lab Exercise Example

This Jupyter Notebook (`Python.ipynb`) demonstrates my Python skills for data analysis, including data loading, manipulation, visualization, etc. This notebook was part of a specific lab exercise given during the IBM course.

**Important Note for Viewing:**
GitHub's built-in viewer might not fully support interactive elements or large outputs within Jupyter Notebooks, which can sometimes cause flickering or display issues. For the most comfortable and accurate viewing experience, and to run the code yourself, please **[open this notebook directly in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Qn6tQBmsZjTBQzL1AXjsLm_KaBO0hSjO?usp=sharing)**.

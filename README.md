## About This Project

This project showcases my SQL skills acquired during an **IBM course**. Throughout the coursework, I gained extensive hands-on experience working with relational databases, processing a wide variety of datasets, and performing complex data retrieval, aggregation, and analysis using SQL. **I completed numerous assignments and performed a vast number of SQL queries as part of these lab exercises.**

**While this repository specifically uses data related to truck trip analysis, I have actively participated in many similar labs with various other datasets and databases.** This continuous learning process is something I genuinely enjoy and find very engaging. I chose this particular project to upload as a representative example of my work and practical abilities.

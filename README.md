# Python Data Analysis Projects

This repository showcases my Python skills for data analysis, acquired during an IBM course.
Throughout the coursework, I gained extensive hands-on experience working with Python for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. I completed numerous assignments and actively participated in a vast number of lab exercises. This continuous learning process, involving various datasets and analytical challenges, is something I genuinely enjoy and find very engaging.

## Python Lab Exercises Examples

This section contains various Jupyter Notebooks, each demonstrating my Python skills in data analysis, including data loading, manipulation, visualization, and more. Each notebook was part of a specific lab exercise given during the IBM course.

**Important Note for Viewing:** GitHub's built-in viewer might not fully support interactive elements or large outputs within Jupyter Notebooks, which can sometimes cause flickering or display issues. For the most comfortable and accurate viewing experience, and to run the code yourself, please open these notebooks directly in Google Colab.
